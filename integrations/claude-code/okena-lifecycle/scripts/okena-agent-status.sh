# okena-agent-status — report an AI agent's lifecycle to Okena.
#
# Writes Okena's agent-status OSC (OSC 9001) to the controlling terminal so the
# Okena tab + the sidebar "Agents" section reflect what the agent is doing, and
# so Okena raises a desktop notification when the agent finishes or gets blocked.
#
# Usage:
#   okena-agent-status <working|blocked|done|idle|clear> [message]
#
# Designed to be wired up as a Claude Code hook (see docs/reference/agent-status.md), but
# it's agent-agnostic — anything that can run a command can call it.
#
# Output device: prefer the pane's *current* slave pty named by
# `$OKENA_TTY_FILE`, then the spawn-time `$OKENA_TTY`, then the controlling
# terminal. See the selection block below for why that order. This drains stdin
# so a hook feeding event JSON on the pipe never blocks, and is a silent no-op
# when there's no device to write to — safe to call from anywhere.
#
# Debugging: set OKENA_AGENT_STATUS_LOG=/path/to/log to append one line per
# invocation recording the state, the target device and where it came from, and
# whether the write actually succeeded. This makes the whole path observable —
# pair it with Okena's own `okena_terminal::terminal::osc_sidecar` debug logs
# (the receiving end) to see where a status update is lost. Unset → zero
# overhead, no file.

state="${1:-}"
message="${2:-}"
# Harness id (e.g. "claude-code", "codex"), set by the per-agent hook glue. Used
# only to tag the captured session in the optional lbl= field; empty is fine.
agent="${OKENA_AGENT:-}"

# Pane this agent runs in, stamped onto the sequence so Okena can drop a status
# that reaches the wrong pane. Empty outside Okena — the param is then omitted.
terminal_id="${OKENA_TERMINAL_ID:-}"

# Pick the device to write to, preferring Okena's own slave pty for this pane.
#
# 1. `$OKENA_TTY_FILE` — a stable path whose CONTENTS Okena rewrites on every
#    spawn and reattach. The only source that stays correct for a pane that
#    outlives Okena: with a session backend (dtach/tmux/screen) the shell — and
#    the agent under it — survives a restart, so its environment still holds the
#    pty of the *previous* run, which Linux has since handed to another pane.
# 2. `$OKENA_TTY` — the same device, captured once at spawn. Correct until the
#    pane outlives the Okena that launched it; also the only one an Okena older
#    than the pointer file exports.
# 3. `/dev/tty` — last resort. It always resolves to the pane's current pty, but
#    under a session backend that is the NESTED pty: with `session_backend =
#    tmux` the pane process is tmux, so a hook's controlling terminal is tmux's
#    own pty, and tmux forwards only a fixed allowlist of OSC numbers — 9001 is
#    not on it, so the sequence dies before reaching Okena's reader. Screen
#    behaves the same way. And a harness that runs its hooks in a new session
#    (Claude Code does) has no controlling terminal at all.
#
# Writing to a device 1 or 2 named means writing to Okena's own slave, which
# bypasses any nested pty. When both are stale the `tid=` param below contains
# the damage: Okena drops a status that lands in a recycled pane rather than
# driving another agent's indicator.
#
# Every probe MUST stay in a subshell. POSIX makes a redirection error on a
# special built-in (`:`) exit the shell, so a bare `: >/dev/tty` aborts this
# script under dash in exactly the case the fallback exists for — and since this
# runs as a PreToolUse hook, a non-zero exit blocks the tool call.
