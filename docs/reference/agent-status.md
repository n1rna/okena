# Agent Status

Okena can show what an AI coding agent is doing in each terminal pane: a per-tab
indicator, a dedicated **Agents** section in the sidebar that lists every active
agent across all projects, a matching field in the [remote API](remote.md), and a
desktop notification when an agent finishes or gets blocked.

Claude Code is supported out of the box via a [bundled plugin](#claude-code-integration).
The protocol is agent-agnostic and the resume logic is per-harness, so adding
another agent is additive — but today Claude Code is the only one that ships
working glue. Codex has a registered harness that declines to resume, and no
capture hooks yet.

The model is **push-based and open**: the agent reports its own state by writing
a small escape sequence to its terminal. Okena never scrapes the agent's output
or reads its private files — an agent (or a thin hook) tells Okena directly. A
small fixed set of lifecycle states drives color, sort order, and notifications;
a free-form message and optional labels carry whatever the agent wants and are
shown verbatim.

## What you see

- **Tab** — the pane's icon is recolored by lifecycle (blocked = red, working =
  yellow, done = green, idle = muted). Hovering the tab shows the agent's
  free-form status text.
- **Sidebar → AGENTS** — a flat, cross-project list of every pane currently
  reporting a status, sorted by attention (blocked → done → working → idle).
  Each row shows the lifecycle dot, the terminal name, its project, and the
  free-form text. Click a row to jump straight to that pane. The section hides
  itself when no agent is active.

  The list is deliberately cross-project, so a row can point at a project the
  current window isn't showing (hidden set, folder filter). Clicking then zooms
  to that project so the pane is actually reachable — the jump goes through the
  same window-aware `focus_terminal_by_id` as sidebar clicks, cursor navigation,
  notification jumps, and remote focus requests, which also keeps a jump made
  from a fullscreened pane in fullscreen.

  The pane border deliberately stays out of it. A status is sticky — nothing
  but the next status clears it — so tinting the border turned a finished turn
  into a permanent alarm around the pane, and doubled up on the tab indicator
  for any pane that has a tab bar. A pane *not* in a tab group (a new project,
  or any leaf of a plain split) therefore shows its agent only in AGENTS and in
  the notification.
- **Notification** — entering `blocked` or `done` raises a desktop notification
  (+ sound), suppressed for the pane you're actively looking at. Gated by the
  normal notification settings.

  Raised by the client that **parsed the transition live**. A transition that
  happens while a client is disconnected is not replayed to it when it
  reconnects: the snapshot restores the *indicator*, but re-notifying on every
  reconnect would spam, so it stays silent. Mobile clients get no notification
  at all today.
- **Remote** — `GET /v1/state` includes `terminal_agent_status` per project, and
  a status change bumps `state_version` so subscribed clients re-fetch.

Agent status is **runtime-only** — it is never written to `workspace.json` and
does not survive a restart. (The *agent session* below is the part that is
persisted.)

### Stale status

A status is removed only by an explicit `st=clear` or by the pane going away.
Nothing ties it to the pane's process, so an agent that dies without sending
`clear` — a crash, `kill -9`, an `exit` that skips its `SessionEnd` hook —
leaves the tab tinted and the pane listed in AGENTS indefinitely. Closing the
pane, or having an agent report again in it, clears it.

## The data model

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `lifecycle` | One of `working`, `blocked`, `done`, `idle`. Drives color / sort / notifications. |
| `custom` | Optional free-form text, e.g. `"running tests 3/5"`. Shown in the tab tooltip and the AGENTS row, flattened to one line and clipped. |
| `labels` | Optional flat `{ "key": "value" }` map of extras. Carried on the wire; no UI renders them yet. The three reserved session keys are stripped out before this map is built. Raw terminal output can still contain the original OSC sequence. |

## The wire format (OSC 9001)

An agent reports its state by writing this OSC sequence to its terminal:

```
ESC ] 9001 ; st=<state> [ ; tid=<terminal-id> ] [ ; msg=<base64> ] [ ; lbl=<base64-json> ] ST
```

- `ESC` is `\033` (0x1B); `ST` is the string terminator `ESC \` (`\033\\`). A
  `BEL` (`\007`) terminator is also accepted.
- `st=` — `working` | `blocked` | `done` | `idle`, or `clear` to remove any
  status. An unknown/missing `st` leaves the current status untouched.
- `tid=` — the pane the status is *for*, from `$OKENA_TERMINAL_ID`. A pane drops
  a sequence addressed to a different id (see "Choosing the output device").
  Optional: omit it and the receiving pane accepts the status.
- `msg=` — base64(UTF-8) of the free-form `custom` text. Base64 keeps the value
  `;`/`ST`-safe.
- `lbl=` — base64(UTF-8) of a flat JSON object, e.g. `{"stage":"verify"}`.
  Three keys are **reserved**: `agent` (harness id, e.g. `claude-code`),
  `session_id`, and `transcript_path`. When `agent` + a UUID-shaped `session_id`
  are present, Okena captures them into the pane's *agent session* — a sticky
  record (it survives, and is captured on, `st=clear`) that is the basis for
  resuming the session. All other keys are free-form.

  The reserved keys are read from the raw label map and then **removed** from
  it, so they never reach `labels` on the wire. They are also the only part of
  an agent status that gets written to disk, so they are validated rather than
  trusted: `session_id` must be a canonical UUID, `agent` must be ≤64 chars of
  `[A-Za-z0-9._-]`, and `transcript_path` must be absolute and free of `..` and
  ≤4096 bytes. Anything else is dropped — a bad `transcript_path` alone doesn't
  discard the session, a bad `agent` or `session_id` does.

Everything on this sequence is **untrusted**. Any process that can write to a
pane — including a `cat` of a hostile file, or a remote host over SSH — can emit
it. That is why the values are bounded and validated, why the resume argv must
be shell-neutral, and why `tid=` exists.

For example, to report "done" with a message, from inside the pane:

```sh
printf '\033]9001;st=done;msg=%s\033\\' "$(printf 'all tests passed' | base64 | tr -d '\n')" > /dev/tty
```

This is the same family of in-band signals Okena already understands
(`OSC 9;4` progress, `OSC 133` shell integration); see the contract note in
`crates/okena-terminal/CLAUDE.md`.

### Choosing the output device

Okena exports two variables naming the pane's own slave pty. Prefer the device
named **inside `$OKENA_TTY_FILE`**, fall back to **`$OKENA_TTY`**, and only then
to the controlling terminal:

```sh
if [ -n "${OKENA_TTY_FILE:-}" ] && [ -r "$OKENA_TTY_FILE" ]; then
    live=$(head -n1 "$OKENA_TTY_FILE")
    [ -n "$live" ] && (: >"$live") 2>/dev/null && dev="$live"
fi
if [ -z "${dev:-}" ] && [ -n "${OKENA_TTY:-}" ] && (: >"$OKENA_TTY") 2>/dev/null; then
    dev="$OKENA_TTY"
elif [ -z "${dev:-}" ] && (: >/dev/tty) 2>/dev/null; then
    dev=/dev/tty
fi
```

Both point at the same device; they differ in **when they were written**.

- `$OKENA_TTY` holds the path itself, captured into the pane's environment when
  the pane is first launched. A pane that outlives Okena — any session backend —
  keeps the value forever, so after a restart it names a pty that is gone or,
  because Linux recycles `/dev/pts/N` numbers, now belongs to a *different*
  pane.
- `$OKENA_TTY_FILE` holds a **path to a file** that Okena rewrites on every
  spawn and reattach, keyed by the pane's terminal id (which does survive a
  restart under a session backend). The path is stable, so capturing it once is
  safe; the device it names is always current. This is what keeps a long-running
  agent reporting across an Okena restart.

`/dev/tty` is last because it is frequently the wrong device or no device at
all. Under a session backend it names the **nested** pty: with `session_backend
= tmux` the pane process is tmux, so a hook's controlling terminal is tmux's
pty — and tmux forwards only a fixed allowlist of OSC numbers, which 9001 is not
on, so the sequence dies before reaching Okena. Screen behaves the same way. And
a harness that runs its hooks in a new session has no controlling terminal at
all: **Claude Code does exactly that**, so for it `/dev/tty` never resolves.
Writing to the pane's slave reaches Okena's own reader and bypasses any nested
pty.

When both paths are stale — an agent still holding the environment of a pane
Okena has since forgotten — a status can still land in the wrong pane. That is
what `tid=` defends against: stamp `$OKENA_TERMINAL_ID` on the sequence and a
pane that isn't the addressee drops it instead of showing another agent's
status.

## Session resume

The reserved `agent` + `session_id` (+ optional `transcript_path`) labels let
Okena remember which AI session a pane is running and bring it back after a
restart:

- **Captured** in-band from `OSC 9001` `lbl=` (see above), validated as a UUID,
  and kept on the pane as a *sticky* record that survives `st=clear`.
- **Persisted** in `workspace.json`: `project.agent_sessions` holds the current
  terminal attachment; `agent_session_history` retains conversation identities
  independently of terminals and projects, deduplicated by `(agent, session_id)`.
  Partial reports do not erase a known transcript path. The daemon drains all
  captured identities, including multiple sessions in one PTY batch and sessions
  reported by hook or service terminals outside the layout.
- **Retained on the pane** on load. Without a session backend a restore clears
  terminal IDs. Before dropping them, `validate_workspace_data` copies each
  surviving session into its terminal leaf's `pending_agent_resume` field. This
  field is persisted with the layout and moves with the leaf through splits,
  tab reordering, normalization, and cross-project moves.
- **Resumed** by the daemon when the **`auto_resume_agent_sessions`** setting is
  on (see [configuration](configuration.md#session-backend)): 
  `spawn_uninitialized_terminals` consumes the queued session as it gives
  the pane its new terminal id, and runs the harness's resume command (for
  Claude Code, `claude --resume <id>`) as the pane's **startup command**,
  chained after any `on_create` hook so the pane still ends up at an interactive
  shell. Off by default — when off, the session is still re-attached to the
  restored pane and shown, just not auto-run.

The queued entry is consumed only after a successful terminal spawn. A failed
spawn retains it across saves and restarts; a pane respawned after success does
not re-resume. New sibling panes do not inherit another leaf's pending session.
Because resume hangs off the *spawn*
path, a pane that re-attaches to a live backend session (tmux/dtach — where the
agent is still running) is never touched.

Opening a saved session or importing a workspace also re-keys each pane's
session onto its new terminal id, so the identity survives — but nothing is
auto-resumed there. Opening a session is a request to open panes, not to re-run
whatever agent last lived in each of them.

> **What the resume actually resumes.** The record is "the last agent session
> this pane ever ran", not "what was running at shutdown". There is no
> `session ended` signal in the protocol — `st=clear` deliberately keeps the
> session — so a pane where you finished with Claude an hour ago and then used

Which command resumes a session is **per-harness** (Claude Code, Codex, …),
selected by the `agent` id through the harness registry — adding a new agent is
additive, with no core change.

> **Resume argv must be shell-neutral.** The command is composed into the pane's
> shell line, so `okena_core::agent_harness::resume_command_line` refuses any
> argv element containing whitespace, quotes, or metacharacters rather than
> quote per dialect. A harness needing more should ship a launcher script.

The resume attachment follows its pane: it moves with a cross-project drag,
survives the undo window of a soft close, and is dropped on a hard close,
finalized soft close, or shell switch. Orphaned attachments are pruned on load.
Conversation history survives these operations and project deletion. Loading an
older workspace copies valid attachments into history before clearing terminal
IDs. Invalid history records are discarded on deserialization.

History stores identities and transcript paths, not transcript contents. It has
no history browser, automatic expiry, or remote snapshot field yet. Projects and
terminals remain the primary model; no Work grouping is required.

## Claude Code integration

The easiest way is the bundled **Claude Code plugin**, which wires up the
lifecycle hooks for you — no editing of `settings.json`, versioned and cleanly
uninstallable. The [`integrations/claude-code/`](../../integrations/claude-code/)
directory is a Claude Code plugin marketplace.

From a clone of this repo:

```
/plugin marketplace add ./integrations/claude-code
/plugin install okena-lifecycle@okena
```

Once the marketplace is registered, you can enable the plugin non-interactively
instead of the second step, in `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{ "enabledPlugins": { "okena-lifecycle@okena": true } }
```

This is *not* an alternative to the first step: `@okena` names the marketplace,
which has to exist before the plugin can resolve.

Then run `claude` inside an Okena pane and watch the tab + AGENTS section react.

The plugin maps Claude Code's lifecycle hooks to agent states:

| Claude Code hook | State | When |
|------------------|-------|------|
| `UserPromptSubmit` | `working` | You submit a prompt — the agent starts working. |
| `PreToolUse` | `working` | The agent is about to run a tool — work resumes. |
| `PostToolUse` | `working` | A tool finished — work continues. |
| `Notification` | `blocked` | Claude needs permission or input. |
| `Stop` | `done` | The agent finished its turn. |
| `SessionStart` | `clear` | A new/resumed session — reset any stale status. |
| `SessionEnd` | `clear` | The agent exited — drop it from the Agents list. |

`PreToolUse` / `PostToolUse` are the recovery edges that the obvious four-hook
mapping is missing: when Claude is `blocked` waiting on you and you answer
(e.g. a permission grant, or answering a question mid-turn), **no
`UserPromptSubmit` fires** — that only fires for a fresh prompt. Without a
"work resumed" signal the pane stays stuck on `blocked` even though the agent is
busy again. Running a tool fires `PreToolUse` (and later `PostToolUse`), which
flips it back to `working`. Ordering is safe: for a permission-gated tool the
sequence is `PreToolUse` (working) → `Notification` (blocked) → you approve →
tool runs → `PostToolUse` (working), and hooks are awaited so the writes never
race — the pane correctly shows `blocked` while you're being asked.

The plugin sets `OKENA_AGENT=claude-code` on each hook command, and the script
mines the hook's stdin event JSON for `session_id` / `transcript_path` and
forwards them in the reserved `lbl=` keys above — that's how Okena learns the
pane's Claude session. It uses narrow regular expressions over Claude's generated
JSON, with no jq dependency: session IDs must be UUID-shaped; paths must be
strings without escapes or control characters. Unsupported paths are omitted
without losing the session ID. A key occurring more than once (for example also
inside `tool_input`) is skipped rather than selecting a potentially wrong value.
This is not a general-purpose JSON parser; it expects Claude's top-level identity
fields. Lifecycle reporting continues even when identity capture is skipped.

It bundles `okena-lifecycle/scripts/okena-agent-status.sh`, invoked via
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`. The script writes to the pane's own slave pty — the
device named by `$OKENA_TTY_FILE`, falling back to `$OKENA_TTY` and then
`/dev/tty` — see [Choosing the output
device](#choosing-the-output-device) for why that order. It's a silent no-op
when there's no device to write to.

### Manual (without the plugin)

If you'd rather not use the plugin, register the hooks yourself. Copy the script
somewhere on your `PATH`:

```sh
install -m 0755 integrations/claude-code/okena-lifecycle/scripts/okena-agent-status.sh ~/.local/bin/okena-agent-status
```

…then add to `~/.claude/settings.json`. Note the `OKENA_AGENT=` prefix on every
command: without it Okena has no harness id, so it drops the session entirely —
you get the indicator, but no persistence and no resume, with no error.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "UserPromptSubmit": [
      { "hooks": [ { "type": "command", "command": "OKENA_AGENT=claude-code okena-agent-status working" } ] }
    ],
    "PreToolUse": [
      { "hooks": [ { "type": "command", "command": "OKENA_AGENT=claude-code okena-agent-status working" } ] }
    ],
    "PostToolUse": [
      { "hooks": [ { "type": "command", "command": "OKENA_AGENT=claude-code okena-agent-status working" } ] }
    ],
    "Notification": [
      { "hooks": [ { "type": "command", "command": "OKENA_AGENT=claude-code okena-agent-status blocked" } ] }
    ],
    "Stop": [
      { "hooks": [ { "type": "command", "command": "OKENA_AGENT=claude-code okena-agent-status done" } ] }
    ],
    "SessionStart": [
      { "hooks": [ { "type": "command", "command": "OKENA_AGENT=claude-code okena-agent-status clear" } ] }
    ],
    "SessionEnd": [
      { "hooks": [ { "type": "command", "command": "OKENA_AGENT=claude-code okena-agent-status clear" } ] }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Debugging

If a pane's status looks wrong (stale `blocked`, nothing showing), make the
whole path observable from both ends:

- **The hook end** — set `OKENA_AGENT_STATUS_LOG` to a writable file in the
  pane's environment. The script then appends one line per invocation recording
  the state, the target device, where that device came from, and whether the
  write actually succeeded:

  ```
  2026-06-23T11:30:01+0200 pid=12345 state=working tty=/dev/pts/7 src=file msglen=0 write=ok
  ```

  `src=` is the device's source: `file` (`$OKENA_TTY_FILE`, always current),
  `env` (`$OKENA_TTY`, frozen at spawn — expect it to be stale in a pane that
  outlived an Okena restart), `ctty` (`/dev/tty`), or `none` (nothing was
  writable). A `write=failed` line means the OSC never reached Okena;
  `skip=bad-state` means the state argument wasn't one Okena
  knows; `skip=no-agent` means a `session_id` was found but `OKENA_AGENT` is
  unset, so the session is being dropped; no line at all means the hook didn't
  fire — or, on native Windows, that the script can't run at all.

- **The Okena end** — `okena_terminal::terminal::osc_sidecar` logs every parsed
  `OSC 9001` at `debug` level (`agent-status[<terminal-id>]: <prev> -> <new>
  (changed=…, notify=…)`), including ignored/unknown/clear cases, so you can see
  what Okena received and decided. Raise the log filter to `debug` to see them.

### Other agents

The script is agent-agnostic: anything that can run a command (Codex, a
Makefile, your own tooling) can call
`okena-lifecycle/scripts/okena-agent-status.sh <state> [message]` to report into
Okena. Set `OKENA_AGENT` to your harness id if you also want session capture.

Resuming a captured session needs a harness registered in
`okena-agent-harnesses`, which maps an `agent` id to the argv that resumes it.
Claude Code is implemented; Codex is registered but declines to resume until its
CLI invocation is confirmed, so a Codex session is captured and shown but not
auto-resumed.
