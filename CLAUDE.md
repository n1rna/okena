# Okena

Cross-platform terminal multiplexer built with Rust and GPUI (from Zed editor).

## Git Rules

- **Never revert or discard changes you didn't make.** If you see unexpected modifications in the working tree (e.g. from worktrees, other branches, or manual edits), leave them alone. Only stage and commit your own work.

## Build Commands

```bash
cargo build
cargo run
cargo test --workspace
```

On Windows, build from **x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022** to avoid link.exe PATH conflicts with Git for Windows.

### Architecture in one paragraph

Okena runs as **two processes**: a GPUI-free daemon that owns all authoritative
state (projects, layouts, PTYs, git, services, hooks, persistence) and thin
clients that own only presentation. The desktop spawns its own local daemon over
loopback; web, mobile and remote clients speak the same protocol. Local and
remote projects render through identical machinery. See
[ADR-0001](docs/decisions/0001-headless-two-process-daemon.md).

### Crate layout

Everything lives in `crates/`; `src/` is only the binary entry point.

| Crate | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `okena-state` | Pure data types: `WorkspaceData`, `ProjectData`, `FolderData`, `WindowState`, `HooksConfig`, `Toast`. No GPUI. |
| `okena-layout` | `LayoutNode` recursive tree + algorithms (split/normalize/merge_visual_state) |
| `okena-hooks` | Lifecycle hook execution (`HookRunner`, `HookMonitor`). Decoupled from `okena-workspace`. |
| `okena-workspace` | `Workspace` entity, persistence, settings, sessions, action methods. Reactor-agnostic via `WorkspaceCx` (gpui optional). |
| `okena-terminal` | PTY management, shell config, session backends |
| `okena-git` | Git status, diff parsing, worktree operations |
| `okena-theme` | Theming system (built-in + custom themes) |
| `okena-ui` | Design tokens, shared UI utilities |
| `okena-files` | File search, file viewer, syntax highlighting |
| `okena-highlight` | syntect/tree-sitter syntax highlighting shared by the file viewer, diff viewer and markdown code blocks |
| `okena-syntax` | tree-sitter declaration facts (name, kind, visibility, span, attributes) for Rust and TypeScript. Sibling of `okena-highlight`: that one colours source, this one describes its shape. |
| `okena-review` | What a comparison is made of: path-based file roles, and the test split that moves `#[cfg(test)]` volume out of implementation — both inline scopes and whole files gated by a `mod` declaration elsewhere |
| `okena-markdown` | Markdown parsing and rendering |
| `okena-views-terminal` | Terminal pane, layout container, split/tabs views |
| `okena-views-sidebar` | Sidebar, project list, folder list, drag-and-drop |
| `okena-views-git` | Diff viewer, worktree dialog, git status UI |
| `okena-views-remote` | Remote connection dialogs |
| `okena-views-services` | Service panel views |
| `okena-remote-client` | Remote client connection manager |
| `okena-services` | Docker Compose, port detection |
| `okena-openspec` | OpenSpec on disk, CLI-compatible: store registry (with the CLI's lock), store identity, root discovery, planning tree, store setup. GPUI-free. |
| `okena-knowledge` | Knowledge stores on disk (ADR-0003): store identity, project `.okena/knowledge.yaml`, okena's per-profile store registry, discovery, the entry tree (docs/skills/agents/templates), clone/fetch/fast-forward sync and store setup over `okena-git`, launch prompts and built-in skills, and project maps (`project-map.yaml`, ADR-0005) read and validated. GPUI-free. |
| `okena-extensions` | Built-in (in-process, GPUI) extension system: usage, status, updater |
| `okena-extension-api` | Rust SDK for extensions installed from git; holds the `okena:extension` WIT (`wit/extension.wit`) |
| `okena-extension-host` | Runs extensions from git as WASM (wasmtime) for the daemon: manifest, permissions, dependency check, install/update/remove. GPUI-free. See `docs/reference/extensions.md`. |
| `okena-views-extensions` | Native views for extensions from git: their own view, table/tree/chart components, Settings → Extensions install and config |
| `okena-ext-usage` | Usage extension: Claude, Codex and Copilot limits on the status bar, which agents chosen in its settings |
| `okena-ext-status` | Status extension: Claude, Codex, GitHub and GitLab status pages on the status bar, which services chosen in its settings |
| `okena-ext-updater` | Self-update system |
| `okena-core` | Shared data types only (no networking): wire schema (`api`), WS message types (`ws`), profiles, theme colors, process bus, key handling. Depended on by every crate. |
| `okena-transport` | Networking/transport over the `okena-core` schema: async client engine (WS connection + TLS pinning, `client` feature) and blocking HTTP + `remote_action` (`blocking-http` feature). Holds the heavy optional deps (tokio/reqwest/tungstenite/rustls) split out of `okena-core`. |
| `okena-mobile-ffi` | uniffi FFI surface for the React Native mobile app (`mobile/rn`); self-contained ConnectionManager / TerminalHolder engine over `okena-core` |
| `okena-app` | Desktop UI/app layer: GPUI views, app coordinator, keybindings, action dispatch. The `okena` binary is a thin shell over this. |
| `okena-app-core` | Headless app-logic layer: global observable settings + action-execution glue over the workspace. No views. |
| `okena-daemon-core` | GPUI-free daemon core: tokio reactor impls, observer reactor, PTY loop, git poller, command loop, `DaemonCore`. |
| `okena-daemon` | Standalone GPUI-free daemon binary. Gate: `cargo tree -i gpui -p okena-daemon` must stay empty. |
| `okena-remote-server` | The HTTP/WS server itself: routes, auth/pairing, PTY broadcaster, daemon bridge, local-daemon discovery. |
| `okena-cli` | `okena <subcommand>` — controls a running instance over the remote HTTP API. Gated before GUI startup in `main.rs`. |
| `okena-tui` | Proof-of-concept terminal UI client for a running daemon. |
| `okena-usage` | Shared usage-bar UI + working-days logic behind the Claude and Codex usage widgets. |

## Docs

Project docs live in [`docs/`](./docs/) and follow a fixed structure — start at
[`docs/CLAUDE.md`](./docs/CLAUDE.md) (the operating manual) and
[`docs/INDEX.md`](./docs/INDEX.md) (the map). In short:

- `docs/reference/` — how the system works now.
- `docs/decisions/` — ADRs (the *why*), immutable.
- `docs/backlog/` — decided work not yet scheduled · `docs/sprints/` — active
  work-plans · `docs/archive/` — shipped.
- `docs/ideas/` — proposals, no commitment.

Path is the status (no `status:` fields); when you finish or supersede something,
move/delete it per `docs/CLAUDE.md`. This file and the per-crate `CLAUDE.md`s
outrank `docs/reference/` where they overlap.
