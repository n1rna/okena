# audit-daemon-client-gaps.sh — find daemon/client wiring "holes".
#
# In the daemon-client architecture the desktop GUI (crates/okena-app + the
# gpui view crates) is a THIN CLIENT: its `Workspace` is a read-only MIRROR and
# the daemon is the single writer + owner of PTYs/services/git. Two recurring
# classes of bug ("X isn't transferred / X isn't wired") are statically
# detectable:
#
#   CAT 1 — GUI does the daemon's job: a handler mutates the mirror Workspace,
#           spawns/kills a local PTY, or writes persistence, instead of
#           dispatching an ActionRequest to the daemon. (Silent no-op / wrong
#           process write.)
#   CAT 2 — daemon drops data: a field exists on a domain type but not on its
#           wire `Api*` projection, so it never reaches the client. (Shows as
#           empty/None — "unwired".)
#
# This is a heuristic linter, not a proof: CAT 1 uses a denylist of data-mutating
# calls (visual/presentation mutations are allowlisted); CAT 2 is a field-name
# diff. Triage each hit. Exit non-zero if any CAT 1 hit is found (CI-gateable).
