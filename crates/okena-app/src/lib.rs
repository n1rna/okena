//! Okena's UI/app layer: the GPUI views, the app coordinator, keybindings,
//! action dispatch, and the thin re-export shim modules over the lower-level
//! crates. Extracted out of the `okena` binary so the binary stays a thin
//! entry point and this layer compiles as its own crate.

// The remote-control server lives in its own crate (`okena-remote-server`).
// Re-exported as `crate::remote` so the moved code's `crate::remote::...`
// references keep working unchanged.
pub use okena_remote_server as remote;

// The headless app-logic layer (global settings + workspace action glue) lives
// in `okena-app-core`. Re-exported as `crate::settings` / `crate::workspace` so
// the moved code's `crate::settings::...` / `crate::workspace::...` references
// keep working unchanged.
pub use okena_app_core::{settings, workspace};

// `macros.rs` declares `#[macro_export] macro_rules! impl_focusable`, which must
// stay exported at this crate's root so `impl_focusable!` resolves in the moved
// code (and as `okena_app::impl_focusable!` from the binary).
