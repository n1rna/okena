//! The agent-session panel — one view of a coding-agent session, shown wherever
//! a session appears.
//!
//! There used to be two of these: a sidebar beside a session's terminal and a
//! card in the Agents overview, separately written and already diverging. This
//! is the single one, rendered at two densities so it fits both a full-height
//! sidebar and a narrow lane.
//!
//! It is an entity rather than a render helper because its hosts are different
//! types — the window and the harness pane — and the actions it offers (focus a
//! worktree, restart the agent, delete the workspace) need a workspace, a focus
//! manager and a daemon client of their own.
