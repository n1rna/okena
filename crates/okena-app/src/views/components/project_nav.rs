//! Getting from a panel to a project: focusing it, or opening its diff.

//! Every panel that lists checkouts — an agent session's, a project's, a task's
//! detail — offers the same two ways out of it, and each had grown its own copy.
//! Free functions over the handles a host already holds, because the hosts are
//! different types.
