# okena-terminal — Terminal Emulation & PTY Management

Wraps `alacritty_terminal` for ANSI processing and `portable-pty` for cross-platform PTY handling.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `terminal.rs` | `Terminal` struct wrapping `alacritty_terminal::Term`. `Arc<Mutex>` for thread safety. Selection, search, scrollback, resize, URL detection. |
| `pty_manager.rs` | `PtyManager` — PTY lifecycle. `PtyHandle` per terminal. Spawns OS reader/writer threads. `PtyOutputSink` trait for broadcasting. |
| `shell_config.rs` | `ShellType` enum, `CommandBuilder` construction. Cross-platform shell detection (bash/zsh/fish/sh on Unix; cmd/PowerShell/WSL on Windows). |
| `session_backend.rs` | `SessionBackend` enum — tmux/screen/dtach on Unix; psmux on Windows; per-distro tmux/dtach/screen inside WSL. |
| `input.rs` | Key-to-bytes conversion. DECCKM cursor mode handling. Platform-specific modifier mappings. |
| `backend.rs` | Terminal backend abstraction. |
| `brief_file.rs` | An agent's opening brief handed over from a file: `@okena-brief-file:<path>` in the launch args is resolved at spawn by a `/bin/sh` wrapper, so the session backend's command does not grow with the brief (tmux refuses more than ~16 KB). Windows/WSL read it back into argv. |
| `process.rs` | Process spawning utilities. |

## OSC sequences (sidecar)

`terminal/osc_sidecar.rs` is a side-channel VTE parser run on the same byte
stream as the main processor, for sequences alacritty ignores or answers
differently than Okena wants: `OSC 7` / `OSC 1337 CurrentDir` (cwd), `OSC 9` /
`OSC 777` / `OSC 99` (notifications), `OSC 9;4` (progress), `OSC 133` (shell
marks, via a separate prompt sidecar), and `XTVERSION`.

### `OSC 9001` — agent status (Okena private)

A **stable contract** other tools depend on (see `docs/reference/agent-status.md`). An AI
agent reports its own lifecycle by writing to its terminal:

```
ESC ] 9001 ; st=<working|blocked|done|idle|clear> [ ; tid=<terminal-id> ] [ ; msg=<b64> ] [ ; lbl=<b64-json> ] ST
```

- `9001` is a private OSC number (not a standard sequence); keep it stable.
- `msg`/`lbl` values are base64(UTF-8) so they stay `;`/`ST`-safe (the VTE parser
  splits OSC params on `;`).
- Unknown/missing `st` leaves the current status untouched; `clear` removes it.
- Parsed into the canonical `okena_core::agent_status::AgentStatus`, stored on
  `Terminal.agent_status` (runtime-only), read via `Terminal::agent_status()`.
  `msg`/`lbl` are clamped on parse (`AgentStatus::new_clamped`) so a hostile pane
  can't pin unbounded memory (custom ≤ a few KB, labels bounded) — mirrors the
  OSC 99 caps.
- `lbl=` reserves three keys — `agent`, `session_id`, `transcript_path`. With an
  `agent` id + a UUID-shaped `session_id`, they're captured into a **sticky**
  `okena_core::agent_session::AgentSession` on `Terminal.agent_session` (read via
  `Terminal::agent_session()`). Unlike `agent_status` it survives `st=clear` —
  and is captured on it, since a harness maps session start/end onto `clear`.
  The daemon drains `take_pending_agent_sessions` into workspace history before
  terminal cleanup, preserving successive identities in one batch. The latest
  identity also sets `agent_session_dirty` for terminal attachment; mirrors do
  not queue persistence updates. Per-harness resume/transcript logic is dispatched
  by `agent` id through the gpui-free `okena_core::agent_harness` registry
  (impls live in `okena-agent-harnesses` — deliberately NOT the `okena-ext-*`
  crates, which pull gpui and so cannot be linked by the headless daemon). A
  non-UUID `session_id` is dropped, and `agent` / `transcript_path` are bounded
  (see `agent_session.rs`) because they are the only agent-status fields that
  reach disk. The three reserved keys are **stripped** from the display labels
  after capture, so session identity is absent from remote status snapshots.
- A change stores into the shared one-shot `remote_dirty` edge (drained via
  `take_remote_dirty`), which the PTY event loop consumes
  (`okena_daemon_core::pty_loop::drain_remote_dirty` — the daemon owns this
  drain; the GUI mirror does not) to bump the remote `state_version`. This edge
  is **generic**, not agent-specific: any runtime-only signal that remote
  clients should see reuses it rather than adding its own changed-edge +
  per-feature drain. A transition into `blocked`/`done` also queues a
  `TerminalNotification` (reusing the OSC 9 notification path + focus
  suppression).
- `pty_manager.rs` exports three env vars into the pane at spawn. All go through
  `launch_environment`, **not** `cmd.env()` after the fact: under a session
  backend the spawned command is `sh -c "tmux new-session …"`, so a late
  `cmd.env` lands on tmux rather than the pane's shell — and an already-running
  tmux server's environment predates Okena entirely. `launch_environment` is
  what gets rendered as tmux `-e KEY=VAL`.
  - `OKENA_TTY` — the pane's slave pty path (portable-pty's `tty_name`, i.e.
    reentrant `ttyname_r`; **not** `libc::ptsname`, whose static buffer races
    concurrent terminal creation). Senders should **prefer** it over
    `/dev/tty`: writing to the slave reaches Okena's own master reader, whereas
    a hook's controlling terminal under tmux/screen is the *nested* pty, and
    those forward only a fixed allowlist of OSC numbers that 9001 is not on.
    It also covers processes with no controlling terminal at all — Claude Code
    runs its hooks in a new session, so for those `/dev/tty` never resolves. It
    is captured once at spawn and a pane can outlive the Okena that launched it,
    so prefer `OKENA_TTY_FILE`; what contains the residual is `tid=` below.
  - `OKENA_TTY_FILE` — path of a file holding that same device, rewritten by
    `crate::tty_pointer` on **every** spawn and reattach and keyed by terminal
    id. A pane's environment can never be updated after launch, so the fix is to
    make the captured value a *stable path* whose contents move: the terminal id
    survives a restart under a session backend, `/dev/pts/N` does not. Without
    it, an agent that outlives an Okena restart writes its status into whichever
    pane inherited its old pty number, where `tid=` silently drops it — the bug
    this exists to fix. Published in `create_terminal_with_id`, revoked in
    `enqueue_session_kill`, and swept at `PtyManager::new` (only pointers whose
    device is gone, so a throwaway test manager can't disturb a live Okena).

    **Security note:** unlike an inherited fd, a *path* can be reopened, and
    Linux recycles `/dev/pts/N` numbers. Any process that outlives its pane (a
    daemonized dev server, a forking postinstall) keeps a way to write into
    whatever pane later inherits that number, and writes to a slave surface as
    terminal *output* — i.e. they are parsed as escape sequences. Same-user, so
    not a privilege boundary, but treat the var as a capability: `tid=` guards
    OSC 9001 specifically, nothing else.
  - `OKENA_TERMINAL_ID` — the pane's terminal id, echoed back as the OSC's
    `tid=`. The sidecar drops a status whose `tid` isn't its own, which is what
    contains the stale-`OKENA_TTY` failure mode above. Note the namespaces
    differ: this is the daemon's **raw** id, while a client-side `Terminal` is
    keyed `remote:{connection}:{raw}` — the sidecar matches the unprefixed
    suffix. Omitted `tid` is accepted.

## Threading Model

Three execution contexts access `Terminal`:

1. **Host reactor thread** — the GPUI main thread in the desktop client, the tokio `LocalSet` in the daemon. Runs `process_output` (via the batched PTY event loop, which lives in `okena-daemon-core/src/pty_loop.rs`), rendering (`with_content`), user input, resize, selection, scroll, and idle-detection reads. This is where the vast majority of field access happens.
2. **Tokio reader task** (all client-side terminals; the desktop is a remote client of its own daemon) — calls `enqueue_output` to buffer data without holding `term.lock()`. Touches only `pending_output`, `dirty`, and `last_output_time`.
3. **Resize debounce timer** — a short-lived `std::thread::spawn` that flushes a trailing-edge resize. Touches only `resize_state` and `transport`.

The PTY reader OS thread does **not** touch `Terminal` directly — it sends `PtyEvent::Data` through an `async_channel` to the host reactor thread, which calls `process_output`. Note the desktop client owns **no** `PtyManager`: local PTYs live in the daemon, and the client's terminals are fed by the remote transport (path 2 above).

### Synchronization primitives

- **`Arc<Mutex<T>>`** — the `Arc` is needed when the value is shared with a sub-struct (`ZedEventListener`, `OscSidecar`) or handed to a background thread (`resize_state`). A few fields (`term`, `last_output_time`, `last_viewed_time`) have a historical `Arc` that is never cloned.
- **`Mutex<T>`** — interior mutability for `&self` methods. All `Mutex`-only fields are currently host-reactor-thread-only; the mutex is for interior mutability, not cross-thread safety.
- **`AtomicBool` / `AtomicU64`** — lock-free signaling: `dirty` (cross-thread with tokio reader), `content_generation` / `waiting_for_input` / `had_user_input` (avoid mutex overhead in the render hot path).

See the doc comments on `pub struct Terminal` in `terminal.rs` for per-field thread-ownership documentation.

## Key Patterns

- **`TerminalsRegistry`**: `Arc<Mutex<HashMap<String, Arc<Terminal>>>>` — shared registry for PTY event routing.
- **Batched PTY processing**: The PTY reader thread sends `PtyEvent::Data` via `async_channel`. The host reactor drains all pending events before notifying, avoiding per-byte updates.
- **Remote output decoupling**: Remote tokio readers call `enqueue_output` (append to `pending_output` + set `dirty`) and ring the manager's capacity-1 activity doorbell. The host reactor's activity pump drains/parses output, then emits targeted pane/sidebar notifications; `with_content` remains the fallback drain. Never restore per-pane polling or hold `term.lock()` on the tokio thread.
- **Persistent dtach teardown**: `SIGTERM` to the dtach master does not propagate to its PTY child tree. Teardown must keep the socket discoverable, revalidate PID birth markers, quiesce/reap descendants before the master, and unlink only after socket death is verified.
- **Teardown fixtures must be bounded**: process-tree teardown tests spawn real
  descendants. Keep the fixture to a handful of processes that die on `SIGKILL` —
  never one that re-forks or ignores signals. Exhausting the PID table makes every
  PTY test in the workspace time out, which reads exactly like a code regression.
- **Shell detection**: Auto-detects available shells on the system. On Windows, detects WSL distros and converts paths (`C:\` → `/mnt/c/`).
