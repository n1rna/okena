/// # Threading model
///
/// `Terminal` is always stored behind `Arc` (in `TerminalsRegistry`) and all
/// methods take `&self`, using interior mutability for mutation. Three
/// execution contexts access the struct:
///
/// 1. **GPUI thread** — the main UI thread. Runs `process_output` (via the
///    batched PTY event loop in `Okena`), all rendering (`with_content`),
///    user-input methods, resize, selection, scroll, and idle-detection reads.
///    This is where the vast majority of field access happens.
///
/// 2. **Tokio reader task** (remote connections only) — calls `enqueue_output`
///    to buffer incoming data without holding `term.lock()`. Only touches
///    `pending_output`, output epochs, `dirty`, and `last_output_time`.
///
/// 3. **Resize debounce timer** — a short-lived `std::thread::spawn` that
///    flushes a trailing-edge resize after the debounce window. Only touches
///    `resize_state` and `transport`.
///
/// The PTY reader OS thread does **not** touch `Terminal` directly — it sends
/// `PtyEvent::Data` through an `async_channel`, which the GPUI thread drains.
///
/// # Synchronization primitives
///
/// - **`Arc<Mutex<T>>`** — the `Arc` is needed when the value is shared with a
///   sub-struct (`ZedEventListener`, `OscSidecar`) or handed to a background
///   thread (`resize_state`). The `Mutex` (from `parking_lot`) provides
///   interior mutability.
///
/// - **`Mutex<T>`** — interior mutability for fields that don't need to be
///   shared outside the `Terminal` struct. All current `Mutex`-only fields are
///   accessed exclusively from the GPUI thread; the `Mutex` is required
///   because `&self` methods need interior mutability, not because multiple
///   threads contend.
///
/// - **`AtomicBool` / `AtomicU64`** — lock-free signaling between the GPUI
///   thread and the tokio reader task (for `dirty` and output epochs), or between
///   the GPUI thread's output path and its render path (for `content_generation`,
///   `waiting_for_input`, `had_user_input`) to avoid mutex overhead on every
