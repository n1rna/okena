//! GPUI-free PTY event loop: the headless analogue of the GUI's batched
//! `async_channel` drain previously hosted by `okena-app`.
//!
//! The GUI reads [`PtyEvent`]s off the [`PtyManager`]'s channel on the GPUI
//! thread, feeds `Data` into the per-terminal `process_output`, and on `Exit`
//! cleans up the PTY handle and lets the [`ServiceManager`] decide whether the
//! terminal was a service (so it can restart it or keep its crash output). The
//! daemon does the same against `Arc<parking_lot::Mutex<…>>` state and a tokio
//! task — but, unlike a thin GUI client, the daemon OWNS the workspace, hooks,
//! and lifecycle state, so it also runs the full terminal-exit lifecycle:
//!
//! * hook-terminal exits → status updates + pending worktree-close resolution
//!   (deleting the worktree project DIRECTLY in the workspace — the GUI client
//!   instead dispatched a remote `DeleteProject`),
//! * `terminal.on_close` hooks for plain user terminals,
//! * hook-exit-via-OSC-title (`__okena_hook_exit:<code>`),
//! * stale soft-close-record cleanup.
//!
//! The only GUI-only bits dropped are the ones with no daemon surface: window /
//! pane notify and soft-close *toast* dismissal (the daemon still does the
//! soft-close workspace-state cleanup, just without the UI toast).
//!
//! ## Runs inside the [`LocalSet`](tokio::task::LocalSet)
//!
//! [`run_pty_loop`] MUST be driven by `spawn_local` (or directly inside a
//! running `LocalSet`): on `Exit` it calls
//! [`ServiceManager::handle_service_exit`](okena_services::manager::ServiceManager::handle_service_exit),
//! which for a crashed-but-restart service calls
//! [`ServiceCx::spawn_main`](okena_services::manager::ServiceCx::spawn_main) —
//! and the daemon's `spawn_main` is `tokio::task::spawn_local`, which panics
//! outside a `LocalSet`. This is the same constraint the observer tasks document
//! (see [`crate::observers`]). The blocking subprocess offloads still reach the
//! multi-thread pool via the held [`Handle`](tokio::runtime::Handle).
