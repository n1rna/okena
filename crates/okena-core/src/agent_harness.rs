//! Per-harness agent capabilities — *resume a session* and *parse a transcript*
//! — keyed by agent id, kept **gpui-free** so they work in the desktop app AND
//! in headless/remote (where resume/stats may be driven from a mobile client).
//!
//! The agent-status protocol is harness-agnostic: a pane reports its `agent` id
//! (`"claude-code"`, `"codex"`, …) plus a `session_id` via `OSC 9001` (see
//! [`crate::agent_session`]). This registry is how Okena turns that id into
//! actions, without baking any single agent's specifics into the core or app.
//! The implementations live in the gpui-free `okena-agent-harnesses` crate and
//! are registered at startup via [`init`]; an unknown id simply has no entry, so
//! its session is stored/displayed but not resumable until a harness for it
//! exists. New harnesses are therefore purely additive.
//!
//! They are kept out of the `okena-ext-*` crates on purpose: those depend on
//! `gpui`, and the standalone `okena-daemon` binary — which owns restore — is
//! CI-gated GPUI-free, so it could not link them and every lookup here returned
//! `None`.
