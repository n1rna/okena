//! Provider-neutral task types for the engineering harness.
//!
//! Every provider (Linear today; Jira / Azure DevOps later) normalizes its own
//! issue representation into [`Task`]. The harness UI and the daemon only ever
//! see these types — nothing provider-specific escapes `okena-tasks`.
//!
//! These live in `okena-core` rather than `okena-tasks` for the same reason the
//! wire schema does: [`TaskRef`] is persisted on `ProjectData`, so `okena-state`
//! must see it, and `okena-state` cannot take on `okena-tasks`' networking
//! dependencies (reqwest/rustls) — it is the pure-data crate everything else
//! depends on. `okena-tasks` re-exports these and owns the client side.
